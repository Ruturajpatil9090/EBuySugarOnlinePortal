For instance, if a user selects a contact in the Registered Members to view their product and prices, we may add that lead to our Leads Central area so that we can suggest similar leads. We will also collect and retain your contact information in a user database as a Registered Member to facilitate future access and usage of the Website. Your PII will not be shared with any third party except as provided in this Policy. While we do not have any current plans to use this PII, we reserve the right to use this PII in the future in order to communicate with you about eBuySugar, improvements in our service, and so forth. In such a case, you will be able to opt-out of future communications when you discontinue your registration with us. In addition, even if you do not register, we may collect PII from you in other ways, such as if you send us an email via the “Contact Us'' page of the Website and cookies. 3.3 Information containing PII may also be collected to complement information obtained by a business partner or by a third party.

We do not log the specific identity of visitors, unless prescribed by the law in India. Technical data is generally used to create broad demographic summaries of the Website usage and activity (such as average time spent and pages viewed) to assist us in providing useful content that is tailored to be of most value to our users.

By using the Website, you consent to the use of the tracking technologies as described above. 3.8 Our Website uses "cookies" and "pixel tags". Cookies are small text files transmitted by a website server to a temporary memory feature located in the personal computer of the website visitor. This gathering technology can be used to recognize repeat users and facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the site, as well as to collect and archive information such as individual user's address and/ or domain name, type of browser, computer operating system as well as related websites.

All eBuySugar employees, agents and contractors who have access to your PII are required to protect the information in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. 3.10 You understand and agree that whether or not your registration is still in force, eBuySugar may sell or transfer to third parties your contact and profile information, including any or all PII you have provided and posted on this Website, in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of eBuySugar or otherwise than in such connection, in exceptional circumstances, provided that the third party to which the information is transferred or sold has expressly committed to protect your PII and seek confirmation from you on any further use of the information.
